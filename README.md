## What is this?

Can't decide what to eat? Where to go? Which board game to play? **Let fate decide for you.**

JuliaSorts is a gloriously over-engineered random picker with a 90s arcade aesthetic. Because making decisions is hard, but pressing a big glowing button is easy.

## Features

- **Neon-soaked UI** — Your eyes will thank you (or curse you)
- **Dramatic spinning animation** — Maximum suspense for maximum fun
- **Quick picks** — Pre-loaded options for the truly indecisive
- **Up to 5 options** — Because more than that is just chaos
- **Zero AI, 100% random** — Pure, unbiased chaos

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and let the sorting begin.

## How to Use

1. Add your options (or pick a quick category)
2. Smash that **SORT IT!** button
3. Accept your fate
4. (Optional) Argue with the result and sort again

## Why "JuliaSorts"?

Because Julia couldn't decide, so we built an app.

Now nobody has to decide. The computer overlords choose for us all.
